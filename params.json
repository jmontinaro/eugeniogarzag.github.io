Until you realize that it is really the most popular digital currency in the world. This is exactly the problem, we as people of the world need to have a basic understanding of a new piece of technology which has the potential of changing economic systems that have mostly remained the same throughout human history. Now why is Bitcoin so popular you might ask yourself? What puts Bitcoin apart from other digital currencies is that it is encrypted, meaning that it is untraceable and until now unhackable unless you personally own more than 50% of the worlds computer processing power. The reason for this is the revolutionary application of a technology called the blockchain. The block chain is the collection of all the computers that use Bitcoin to anonymously approve transactions based on the electronic account signature and prevent people from cheating on the system. Bitcoin is a great way to transfer money because there is no bank or government regulating the flow of money, meaning that there is no transaction costs for using Bitcoin making it very attractive for users [(Learn more about how Bitcoin works)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs). \r\n\r\n#####Bitcoin's Troubled Past\r\nNow Bitcoin isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, like any great piece of technology it can be used in a negative way to harm others. The cryptographic nature of the currency makes it impossible for government agencies to trace money used in illegal transactions. This was the case for a website called the Silk Road, an anonymous black marketplace that could not be accessed by regular means, a special internet browser called Tor had to be used in order to sell the website. Websites like [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)) used to face a huge problem in terms of cash transactions which could be traced removing the anonymity that the website offered. With the rise in popularity of Bitcoin, now both the website and the currency used to buy and sell contraband where completely encrypted and untraceable. The website became so popular that the site’s administrator, Ross William Ulbricht, had a [fortune of almost $30 million dollars in Bitcoins](http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/25/fbi-says-its-seized-20-million-in-bitcoins-from-ross-ulbricht-alleged-owner-of-silk-road/#59030ee41440) from sales commissions in just two years of the sites operation [(Read WIRED’s three part story on the FBI’s operation on shutting down Silk Road)](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/). \r\n\r\n#####Bitcoin's Bright Future\r\nThis may make it seem like digital currencies are just ways for criminals to protect their interests but this is not the case. Bitcoin, the blockchain and other digital currencies are the future of economics and we should embrace them. Sweden is now moving towards a cashless society, acknowledging the fact that physical money is outdated and is the cause of various robberies [(WIRED story here)](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/sweden-cashless-economy/). Bitcoin’s anonymity makes it impossible to know the percentage of people who use Bitcoin for illicit purpose, but like any new technology the wielder chooses whether to use it for good or evil. The world is always changing and we need to adapt to changes, which is why I invite you to read, discuss and talk about this potential revolutionary technology which [big banks are already embracing](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/big-tech-joins-big-banks-to-create-alternative-to-bitcoins-blockchain/). Remember the words of Martin Luther King, “Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity.”\r\n\r\n###Sources\r\n[http://www.wired.com/2015/12/big-tech-joins-big-banks-to-create-alternative-to-bitcoins-blockchain/](http://www.wired.com/2015/12/big-tech-joins-big-banks-to-create-alternative-to-bitcoins-blockchain/)\r\n\r\n[http://www.wired.com/2016/05/sweden-cashless-economy/](http://www.wired.com/2016/05/sweden-cashless-economy/)\r\n\r\n[https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/)\r\n\r\n[http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/10/25/fbi-says-its-seized-20-million-in-bitcoins-from-ross-ulbricht-alleged-owner-of-silk-road/#59030ee41440\r\n\r\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace))\r\n\r\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9jOJk30eQs)",
